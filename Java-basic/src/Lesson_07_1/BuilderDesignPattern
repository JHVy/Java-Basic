#Contect
- Different attribute data set
- If constructor overloading -> multiple constructors
- If any constructor (true, null) -> Logic become more complex

#Builder Design Pattern
- Using the concept Encapsulation
- In main class from constructor, attributes: private
- Inner static class builder: same attributes with main class, Service methods (attribute) -> Builder
- Finally in the Builder class: build -> Book -> book : Immutable
